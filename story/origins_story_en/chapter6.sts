I quit my job and stopped being a programmer. And got divorced too, but that's another story. 
I thought - I just need to write scripts. A lot. So much so that it would be enough to learn. I'll explain: a good programmer can write any program when needed. And without inspiration (although it helps a lot). So, I'll be a writer when I can write stories in exactly the same way. Just using skills.
