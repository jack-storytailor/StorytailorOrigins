And so here I was, a person who had firmly decided never to program again, spending months, sometimes several sleepless days in a row, hammering out this programming language, constantly reminding myself that I was crazy.
This is not how it's done. If you want to change professions - change it. And I, it turns out, only changed it in words.
Moreover, I was writing in JavaScript, a language I hardly knew (I was more into servers or desktops, and in recent years - only Unity3D), so I had to learn JavaScript additionally, which meant more time lost.

By the middle of last summer (2018), I had the first version ready. It was severely cut down, but it was a fully functional, working concept. A programming language for assembling texts. It's called Storytailor (a play on words from the English 'story' and 'tailor'). Until the new year, I tested it as a user, i.e., as a screenwriter, not a programmer. When I already had a list of features that were missing, I sat down to program again.
