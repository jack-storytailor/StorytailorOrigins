A couple of years later, an acquaintance of mine, a very novice director, asked me to act in his short film. I ended up on the set. 
The shooting was hell. The director constantly argued with everyone he could reach, the script was terrible, and I had to take unpaid leave from work, with each day of shooting costing me $300 in lost salary. And despite all the problems combined, it was an amazing experience. 
I realized that I couldn't live without cinema. 
At that time, I thought that when I have my own project, I won't repeat the mistakes of my acquaintance, the director. 'Well, it's got to be no harder than being a team leader and product owner on production'Â©.
