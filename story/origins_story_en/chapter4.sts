I wanted to write books, but I had no idea how to make money from it. So, I wrote programs. It's simpler with them - pure mathematics, and they pay as if they can't write it themselves. 
On the other hand, you can't complain - wanted to write? Well, there you go, write. Programmers write an order of magnitude more text than any playwright or copywriter.
